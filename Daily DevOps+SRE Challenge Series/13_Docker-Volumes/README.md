# Day 13 Challenge: Mastering Docker Volumes for Persistent Applications

Docker volumes provide flexibility and enhanced functionality for containerized applications through persistence, isolation, sharing, and backup and migration.
The challenge covers key Docker volume commands, such as listing, creating, inspecting, removing, and pruning unused volumes.

## Objectives:
1. Use Docker volumes to persist data for Redis and PostgreSQL components in the Yelb application.
2. Verify data persistence by stopping and removing the containers and restarting them to confirm that data is retained.
