
1. Create a Deployment <br/>
        Name: testdeploy <br/>
        Image: gaigoleb2/cuswebsrvhostname:v1 <br/>
        Replicas: 10 <br/>
        Strategy: Recreate <br/>
        
2. Create a service to expose the Deployment <br/>
        Service name: test-svc <br/>
        Service type: NodePort <br/>
        port: 8000 <br/>
        targetPort: 80 <br/>
        
3. Check website output using curl <br/>
    
4. Perform upgrade using recreate strategy <br/>
        Image: gaigoleb2/cuswebsrvhostname:v2 <br/>
        
5. Check the status of the upgrade <br/>
    
6. Perform rollback upgrade <br/>
    
7. Check the status of the upgrade <br/>
    
8. Edit the deployment to perform upgrade using rolling upgrade strategy and this time record the version <br/>

Solution:

1. Create deployment
```
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: testdeploy
spec:
  replicas: 10
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      env: prod
  strategy:
    type: Recreate
  template:
    metadata:
      name: testpod
      labels:
        env: prod
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: testcontainer
          image: gaigoleb2/cuswebsrvhostname:v1
```
2. Create a service to expose the Deployment
```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: testsvc
spec:
  type: NodePort
  selector:
    env: prod
  ports:
    - targetPort: 80
      port: 8000
      nodePort: 32000
```
3. Check website output using curl
```
$ while :; do curl --silent 192.168.49.2:32000; sleep 3; done

4. Perform upgrade
```
$ kubectl set image deployment testdeploy testcontainer=gaigoleb2/cuswebsrvhostname:v2
deployment.apps/testdeploy image updated
```
5. Upgrade status
```
$ kubectl rollout status deploy testdeploy
